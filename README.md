# JavaScript-Tutorial
Master JavaScript and GitHub at the same time! Fork this repo and develop a project with guidance!

# Inspiration
I wanted to spend the evening re-learning Java-Script while at the same time practicing my git skills. I was surprised to not find a JS tutorial that is meant to be forked and 'developed'. So I am making one myself while learning JS!

I am learning, thus highly appreciate feedback or contributions from anyone else. Thanks
