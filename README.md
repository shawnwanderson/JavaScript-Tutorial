# JavaScript-Tutorial
Master JavaScript and GitHub at the same time! Fork this repo and develop a project with guidance!

# Inspiration
I wanted to spend the evening re-learning Java-Script while at the same time practicing my git skills. I was surprised to not find a JS tutorial that is meant to be forked and 'developed'. So I am making one myself while learning JS!

I am learning, thus highly appreciate feedback or contributions from anyone else. Thanks

# To Begin The Tutorial
1. Fork me on github
2. clone your fork
  *git clone [YOUR URL]
3. fetch the first tutorial branch
  *git add remote origin tutorial1
  *git fetch origin tutorial1
4. checkout that branch
  *git checkout tutorial1
5. begin developing JavaScript!


# There May be Bugs in Anything I type
It is up to you to find the right commands and code for yourself. Please contribute corrections back to this repo via pull requests.
